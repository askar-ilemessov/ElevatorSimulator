SYSC 3303 ReadMe file Group 9, Author:Yasin jaamac

This is the first milestone of the group project which includes a scheduler class/scheduler test, a main, elevator class/elevator test, Floors class/test. The authors of this iteration is Yasin Jaamac, Danish Butt, Madelyn Krasnay and Askar IIemessov. The elevator class contains an implementation of how the elevator system works. The floor class has a implementation of the floor subsystem and the scheduler has the scheduler for the elevator. One of the issues we had was that the file reader needs to be finished, we couldnt figure out how to get the code to read in a file and checking the build path. Also some issues with the tests.
